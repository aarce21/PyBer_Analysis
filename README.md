# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine weekly ride sharing metrics for PyBer, a ride sharing company. Our goal was to compare the weekly rates in Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities to compare the revenue and see if there are any disparities among the different city types. In this analysis, we determined metrics such as the total rides, total drivers, total fares, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver in each of the city types. We used each of these metrics to perform an analysis to create a line graph that depicts the total fare by city type on a weekly basis in Jan 2019-April 2019. The end goal of this analysis was to use the Total Fares by City Type graph to make recommendations to the CEO of PyBer that could help solve the disparities among the different city types. 
# Results of the Analysis
After running the analysis for the different city types to determine the total number of rides and the total fares, we are able to see that there are disparities in the numbers for Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. This can be seen in the image below. 
![city_fares](https://github.com/aarce21/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_fares.PNG)
Urban cities have the greatest number of total rides and total drivers and the highest dollar amount of total fares at $39,854.38. Suburban cities come in second place for total rides, total drivers, and total fares while Rural cities come in last, at $4,327.93. We can also see from the chart that Rural cities had the highest value for average fare per ride and average fare per driver, due to having the least number of total rides and therefore, need to charge more per ride to keep up their revenue. The drivers in the rural cities are making more revenue per ride even though they have the smallest amount of total rides. With 1,625 total rides, Urban cities bring in the greatest revenue. 

The line chart that we created, depicting the total fare by city type from Jan-April 2019 can be seen below.

By looking at the graph, it appears that each of the city types follow similar patterns for the first few months of the year. Urban cities consistently have the highest fare amount and Rural cities have the least no matter what month it is. There is an uptick in total fares for Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities at the end of February. Urban cities also see an increase two other weeks in March and Suburban cities appear to have an increase at the end of April while Urban and Rural cities are showing a decrease.
